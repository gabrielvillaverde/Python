====================================

- Your main job is to guess the word.
- If the guessed letter is in the word, it's revealed; if not, part of a hangman figure is drawn.
- The guessing player continues until they guess the word or complete the hangman figure.
- The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the hangman is completed, resulting in a loss.
- You have up to 6 attempts. Good luck!
