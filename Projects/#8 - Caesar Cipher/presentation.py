Welcome to Caesar Cipher! In this program, you can encrypt your messages and send them to someone who knows the corresponding code. 
If someone intercepts your message, they will need to enter the code, which is supposed to be known only to the person you're really sending the message to.
Through Caesar Cipher, you will encrypt your messages based on the alphabet and the positions that can be shifted according to the number of movements you specify.
