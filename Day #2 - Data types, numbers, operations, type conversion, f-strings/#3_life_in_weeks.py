# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

age = input("What is your current age? ")

int_age = int(age)

years_left = 90 - int_age
days_left = years_left * 365
weeks_left = years_left * 52
months_left = years_left * 12

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks and {months_left} months left.")
